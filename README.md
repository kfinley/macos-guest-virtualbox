## One-Key-Installation of macOS Mojave 10.14.1 on VirtualBox

The "one key" is enter, which has to be pressed whenever the virtual machine is ready for the next command. (Contrary to the script's name, the user has to use more than one key! There is one instance when the "host key" is used to release the mouse from the virtual machine, and one instance where the user has to choose [y]es or [n]o!)

The goal of the script is to allow for a very easy installation without any closed-source additions or extra bootloaders.

Tested on Cygwin, should work on Linux distros.
